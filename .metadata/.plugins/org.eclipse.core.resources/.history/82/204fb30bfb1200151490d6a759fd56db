			"graphics": "The textures and character models are crisper, and the framereate is smoother than on last-gen consoles",
			"sound": "Lots of ambient noises, pained grunts, and snarling enemies. The sparsely used score helps accentuate intense moments",
			"playability": "The most immediately accessible of the Souls series, but the rigid, deliberate combat still requires a lot of patience from newcomers",
			"entertainment": "The new enemy arrangements don’t trump the original Dark Souls II, but it’s still a great jumping-on point",

			"sound": "Groans, shrieks, and the sound of bells punctuate the journey. The amazing soundtrack highlights everything from the serene and peaceful to adrenaline fueled boss battles",
			"playability": "You get some instruction at the beginning, but players learn new things the whole way through. A difficult and demanding single-player experience with multiplayer components that can provide solace for those who seek it",
